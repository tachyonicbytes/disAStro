#+TITLE: disAStro

* Introduction
=disastro= is an AssemblyScript distribution, similar to Anaconda for Python, and Spring for Java.

=disastro= wants to be a growing collection of AssemblyScript packages, organized in an easy-to-develop manner.

This work is extremely experimental. You know what to do.
** Stewardship
Am I a good steward for the project? You can check the project name for that.

* Usage
For now, I only integrated the `as-big` and `json-as` packages. The entire usage stands now at:

#+begin_src bash
npm install disastro
#+end_src

#+begin_src typescript
import { Big, JSON } from "disastro/assembly/index.ts";
#+end_src

* Motivation
Working with AssemblyScript, I wanted to build my own toolkit in order to ease the process. AssemblyScript already provides a good standard library, but there are many great AssemblyScript packages that I wanted to use easily.

* Design
- Installation command should be the very simple =npm install disastro=
- Ease of use: the principal use pattern should be =import { Foo, Bar, Baz } from disastro=
